I didn&rsquo;t hit all of the items in the release notes so make sure you pull up the PDF and check out all of the goodies for this release. Also check out the <a href="http://developer.force.com/releases/release/Winter11">Winter '11 Force.com Platform Release Preview page</a>.<br clear="all">
<p><strong>User Interface</strong></p>
</p><ul><li>A new Global search with advanced search functionality and content. From the header search box you can search more records, including articles, documents, products, solutions, and Chatter feeds, files, groups, and people. You can also search more fields, including custom fields, and long text fields such as descriptions, notes, and task and event comments. You can use wildcards, operators, and filters to refine your search. This should be great for users as search was lacking.</li><li>A new user interface header displaying Global Search (if Chatter is enabled), a new drop down menu under user's name for setup, my profile and logout, and restyled apps menu.</li><li>The Setup section now displays with the new enhanced (blue) interface.</li></ul><p>
<strong>Salesforce for Outlook</strong>
<p>If you use Microsoft Outlook then you are going to love the Winter 11 release! Over 37 pages of the release notes are devoted to Salesforce for Outlook. It looks to be a huge upgrade from Connect for Outlook. Salesforce for Outlook adds sync for multi-day events, adds "email added" indicators, enhances filtering of synced contacts, prevents duplicate contacts from being created, moves administration settings to the cloud, searches contact roles when adding new emails, allows syncing of all events, provides simple contact sync, and provides support for Windows 7 64-bit and Outlook 2010. There are a ton (I mean <strong>TON</strong>) of changes so make sure read the docs.</p>
<p><strong>Sales Cloud Enhancements</strong></p>
</p><ul><li>Quote templates are now GA and include repeating headers and footers, field alignment, rich text capabilities, simplified addition of graphics and preview during creation.</li><li>You can now add attachments to events and tasks. Awesome!!</li><li>A file attached to a Chatter feed on a record is automatically added to the record's Notes and Attachments related list as a Feed Attachment.</li></ul><p>
<strong>Chatter Enhancements</strong>
<p><strong>Files</strong> - You can easily upload, store, find, and follow Salesforce.com files (Chatter files and Salesforce CRM Content) in the cloud using the Files tab. Files are accessible from the All Files, My Files, Files in My Groups and Files in My Workspaces list views. Chatter files and CRM Content Files are not the same but it looks like they are both using Content on the backend. The Files tab requires no administration and can be used right away however Salesforce CRM Content requires administrator setup and includes workspaces, content packs, and content deliveries. Files are stored in fully searchable file repositories known as workspaces. So just to recap, Salesforce.com now includes Files, Content, Documents and Attachments.</p><ul><li>Next to the Home tab there is now a Chatter tab. This tab displays All Chatter (feed updates, including posts, status updates, group updates, and record updates), To:Me (posts to your feed), People (people you follow) and Groups (updates for groups you are a member of).</li><li>You can now enable following for events, tasks, reports, and dashboards.</li><li>Knowledge base users can now follow a published article if Salesforce Knowledge article types are enabled for Chatter.</li><li>You can share a Chatter file on an existing record.</li><li>You can share private Files to Chatter feeds.</li><li>You can add Chatter Topics to posts and comments to tag and categorize your updates.

Only supports SoftPhones built with CTI Toolkit v.3.0.</li><li>New CTI Developer's Toolkit to build CTI adapter. </li><li>High Volume Customer Portal User License now available so that a large numbers of users logging into yous Customer Portal does not affect its performance.</li><li>Create security sharing sets to group high-volume portal users by their profiles and target them with different levels of access to records.</li><li>Web-to-Case limit increased to 5000 new cases per day (was 500 cases per day).</li><li>On-Demand Email-to-Case limit increased to 2500 email messages per day. </li></ul><p>

<strong>Visual Process Manager</strong> (aka Force.com Flow) &mdash; Pilot
This looks really cool based upon the description. Force.com Flow gives you the tools to create an application for easily navigating users through a series of screens, and querying and updating Salesforce.com data, without writing any code. The Flow Designer lets administrators or business analysts quickly build the flow to connect screens together. It also allows you to execute logic and provides branching capability based on user input which can be used to build dynamic applications.
