title:  Ghost CLI
description: Since the Ghost blogging platform does not currently include a CLI (as of 0.4.2), I decided to build one with some simple admin functionality. I needed a number of these functions when I ported this blog from WordPress to Ghost. With almost 500 posts, I had a number things that needed to be corrected and cleaned up. I had bad HTML, images that didnt properly migrate to Cloudinary and a number of other issues. You can install the CLI from this repo.  The CLI operates from the export of your blogs

<p>Since the Ghost blogging platform does not currently include a CLI (as of 0.4.2), I decided to build one with some simple admin functionality. I needed a number of these functions when I ported this blog from WordPress to Ghost. With almost 500 posts, I had a number things that needed to be corrected and cleaned up. I had bad HTML, images that didn't properly migrate to Cloudinary and a number of other issues.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/jeffdonthemic/ghost-cli">You can install the CLI from this repo.</a></strong></p>
<p><img src="images/ghost-cli.png" alt="" ></p>
<p>The CLI operates from the export of your blog's settings and data. Any changes made using the CLI are not reflected in your blog. You must manually update your blog.</p>
<p>Ghost is expected to release a CLI with an upcoming version so this may become obselete shortly. In the meantime, I hope you find it useful.</p>
<p>This video covers installation and an overview of the CLI's functionality.</p>

<p>There's also a bonus command called <code>waybackit</code>. This command will search a file for images by a root (let's say youf WordPress content URL), look for the image in the Wayback Machine and if found, update that file with the new URL.</p>
