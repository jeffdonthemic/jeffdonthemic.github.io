title:  Announcing the Force.com & Heroku Weekly Newsletter
description: Im been a fan of the Ruby , JavaScript , Node.js and Postres weekly newsletters and just realized that there is not one for Force.com and Heroku. So I decided to blatantly rip off the idea and start one! The goal is to curate articles that I think might be interesting to Force.com and Heroku developers and deliver it every Thursday for your reading enjoyment.   Go ahead and sign up while you are thinking about it.  Ill start sending out issues the first week of October to give people time to sub

<p>I'm been a fan of the <a href="http://rubyweekly.com/" target="_blank">Ruby</a>, <a href="http://javascriptweekly.com/" target="_blank">JavaScript</a>, <a href="http://nodeweekly.com/" target="_blank">Node.js</a> and <a href="http://postgresweekly.com/" target="_blank">Postres</a> weekly newsletters and just realized that there is not one for Force.com and Heroku.

<p><strong><a href="http://eepurl.com/EUo6H" target="_blank">Go ahead and sign up</a> while you are thinking about it.</strong> I'll start sending out issues the first week of October to give people time to subscribe.</p>
<p>I've set up a Twitter account (<a href="https://twitter.com/forceweekly" target="_blank">@forceweekly</a>) and am looking to get a logo designed and perhaps a new Wordpress theme.</p>
<p>As I stated, I will be curating articles for the newsletter but if you have any links you would like to include, please send them to me and I'll take a look at them. I'm not sure the best way to collect these (spreadsheet, twitter hashtag, form, etc.) so perhaps leave a comment with your suggestions.</p>
