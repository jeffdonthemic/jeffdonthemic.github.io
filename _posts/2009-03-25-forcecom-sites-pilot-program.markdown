<p>Today it's official. I just received my login access to the <a href="http://wiki.developerforce.com/index.php/SitesPilot:Sites_Pilot" target="_blank">Force.com Sites Pilot</a> and <a href="http://community.salesforce.com/sforce/board?board.id=pilotprogram" target="_blank">Discussion Boards</a>. We are kicking off a Sites Pilot for one of our companies sponsored by our CIO so I am really getting into the nuts and bolts of Sites. I'll try to share some of my experiences with the process.</p>
<p>In addition we are also piloting the new <a href="http://www.salesforce.com/products/ideas/" target="_blank">Ideas Portal</a> and working through those "challenges". We hope to have an internal IT Ideas pilot up and running within the week. Apparently we should receive the Apex and Visualforce code for the Idea Portal within the next couple of weeks and I'll be able to start making modifications for our implementation. We hope to push the project up to the global marketing department.</p>
