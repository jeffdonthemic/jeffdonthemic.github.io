title:  Salesforce.com Robot for Google Wave
description: Cross-posted at the Appirio Technology Blog This is a small Google Wave robot that interacts with Salesforce.com to display contacts, accounts and opportunities. The robot is currently a work in progress as Ive been busy with other work projects, getting ready for Dreamforce 09  and working on a Twilioforce demo. If you have any ideas for future functionality or comments, please let me know. The robot is currently hooked up to my developer account but you are free to add it to a wave and try out
