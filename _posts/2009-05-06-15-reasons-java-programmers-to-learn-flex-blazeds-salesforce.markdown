<p>My favorite reason is #3, "You can have a job in another six months". If you are out of work right now why not get started learning Flex and BlazeDS? Adobe is <a href="https://freeriatools.adobe.com/learnflex/?PID=1225267" target="_blank">offering unemployed developers free licenses of Flex Bulider</a> to help you get back in the game. You can also learn Salesforce.com and get into cloud computing. <a href="/2009/04/08/start-developing-with-salesforcecom-today/" target="_blank">Here's how you can get started</a> for free.</p>
