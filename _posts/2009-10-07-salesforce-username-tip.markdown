<p>If you are like me you probably have 1.35 million Salesforce usernames. You have usernames for productions orgs, sandboxes, developer orgs, pre-release orgs, partner portals, etc. and they all <strong>must be unique</strong>. So how do you manage this chaos in a manner that doesn't drive you insane with password resets and security tokens?</p>
<p>If you are using Gmail or Google Apps there is a easy way to manage your Salesforce usernames using address aliases. For instance, if your email address is <a href="mailto:coolsalesforceguy@gmail.com">coolsalesforceguy@gmail.com</a>, you can add a "+" and some sort of identifier to your Gmail address to create unique email addresses that are delivered to your one Gmail inbox. Therefore, you could do things like:</p>
<ul>
	<li>coolsalesforceguy+prd@gmail.com</li>
	<li>coolsalesforceguy+sandbox1@gmail.com</li>
	<li>coolsalesforceguy+de7@gmail.com</li>
	<li>coolsalesforceguy+customer1prd@gmail.com</li>
</ul>
You can then set up filters to automatically direct these messages to Trash, apply a label or star, skip the inbox, or forward to another email account.
