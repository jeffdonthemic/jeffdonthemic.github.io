Tuesday, September 18 - 1:00 p.m. - 1:30 p.m.	<br>
Moscone Center West, Developer Theater	<br>
Discover how to develop Apex web service callouts in the absence of a real endpoint. We will build out a mock Node.js endpoint app and show how to handle Get, Post, Put and Delete HTTP requests in JSON, implementing a matching Apex callout. We will introduce a design pattern that uses polymorphism to increase test coverage and ease modifications. Finally we will cover hosting the web service and give an overview of how all these parts fit together.</p>
