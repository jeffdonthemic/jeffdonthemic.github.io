<p>I logged on to Google Reader to catchup on the latest technology news and saw a shiny, "New" link. Of course since I like anything labeled as "new" (especially from Google) I decided to click it.</p>
<p>Google <a href="http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2007/05/oh-sam-i-am-can-i-read-it-on-tram.html" target="_blank">officially released</a> Google Gears, a browser plugin that enables offline web applications. Once you've installed Google Gears, you can download your latest 2,000 items so they're available even when you don't have an internet connection.</p>
<p>Google Gears is an open source browser extension that lets developers create web applications that can run offline. Gears provides three key features:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A local server, to cache and serve application resources (HTML, JavaScript, images, etc.) without needing to contact a server</li>
	<li>A database, to store and access data from within the browser</li>
	<li>A worker thread pool, to make web applications more responsive by performing expensive operations in the background</li>
</ul>
Like everything else with Google this is a "developer release" and they are asking for feedback. Google have also made Google Gears available to developers to write their own offline applications utilzing the API. Perhaps when I find some free time (yeah right!) I'll look at it closer. They have a number of sample application to get up and running quickly.
