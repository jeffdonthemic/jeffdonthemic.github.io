title:  New Salesforce.com WYSIWYG Page Layout Editor
description: Looks like Salesforce.com is busy upgrading sandboxes for the next release. I logged into one of our sandboxes this morning and was presented with the new page layout editor and accompanying video. Talk about cool! This new WYSIWYG, drag-n-drop editor will make designing layouts a breeze. I love cloud updates.
