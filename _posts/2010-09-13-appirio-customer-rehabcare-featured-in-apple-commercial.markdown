title:  Appirio Customer, RehabCare, Featured in Apple Commercial
description: Our customer RehabCare is currently being featured in a really nice video on Apples iPad in Business website. I just finished up this project with a lot of other great people from Appirio and RehabCare on the team. Very fun and challenging work integrating with Google Health in addition to writing tons of Apex on the Force.com platform. You can watch the video here .
