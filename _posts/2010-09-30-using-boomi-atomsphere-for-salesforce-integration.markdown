title:  Using Boomi Atomsphere for Salesforce Integration
description: Ive done a number of videos on integration tools over the past year including  DemandTools ,  PeopleImport ,  Talend  and  Informatica .

<p>I've done a number of videos on integration tools over the past year including <a href="/2009/09/28/video-demandtools/">DemandTools</a>, <a href="/2009/10/06/video-peopleimport/">PeopleImport</a>, <a href="/2009/12/02/video-talend-open-studio/">Talend</a> and <a href="/2009/09/21/video-informatica-data-loader/">Informatica</a>. The last few projects that I have worked on involved a integration with <a href="http://www.boomi.com">Boomi Atomsphere</a> so I thought I put together a short video on its usage.</p>
<p>If you have an integration project I would certainly recommend looking at Boomi. It feels a lot like an old-school EAI tool in the fact that it connects to a large number of disparate systems, relies heavily on XML and allows you to drag-and-drop and connect component to create integration orchestrations. It's extremely powerful but what really makes it shine, IMHO, is the test mode where you can execute processes and watch the data flow back and forth across the wire. It makes debugging integrations much simpler.</p>
