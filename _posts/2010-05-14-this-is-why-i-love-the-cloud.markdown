<p>I blew out the harddrive on my MacBook Pro yesterday during a meeting. Kaput. Dead. Nada. After working with Apple Support for a couple of hours I took it to the Apple store and they sent away for a new harddrive. I'll be up and running this afternoon thanks to Apple and Time Machine.</p>
<p>However the best thing about this experience is that it reaffirms my love of the cloud. Besides the time I spent directly working with Apple, I didn't miss a beat. I fired up another laptop running Ubuntu and I was back to work in no time.</p>
<p>Here's what makes working in the cloud so enjoyable...</p>
<p><strong>Email</strong> - Since we use Google Apps for the Appirio domain all of my mail is stored in the cloud. I didn't have to reinstall Office, recover my PST file or restore a backup. All of my mail was instantly accessible.</p>
<p><strong>Documents</strong> - We run all of our projects on Google Apps so I didn't lose any info on the three projects on which I am currently working. All of the docs and spreadsheets that I needed were instantly accessible with the latest versions. Again, no software to install or backup files to locate.</p>
<p><strong>Development Environment</strong> - Development with Salesforce.com in the cloud is a snap. I installed Eclipse and then the Force.com IDE plugin in a matter of minutes. I simply created a new Force.com project which pulls down all of the source code from the server. I'm back to work! I could have just as easily used the browser to develop but I prefer Eclipse.</p>
<p><strong>Notes</strong> - I'm <a href="http://salesforcehandbook.wordpress.com" target="_blank">working on a new Salesforce.com book</a> with <a href="http://th3silverlining.com/" target="_blank">Wes Nolte</a> and initially thought that I had lost some of my notes pertaining to it. Then I remembered that I have been using <a href="http://www.evernote.com" target="_blank">Evernote</a> for notes and <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/" target="_blank">DropBox</a> for chapters and working materials. Both services have a web interface, iPhone apps and desktop apps for Ubuntu (not sure about Evernote?) so accessing these files was a piece of cake.</p>
<p><strong>Passwords</strong> - One of the things I was concerned about was the passwords to all of my websites. Luckily I started using <a href="https://lastpass.com/" target="_blank">LastPass</a> recently so I just needed to install the LastPass Firefox plugin and log into my account.</p>
<p><strong>Bookmarks</strong> - I store all of my bookmarks at <a href="http://www.delicious.com" target="_blank">delicious</a> so I had instant access from any computer.</p>
