title:  UK Force.com Developer & Admin Meetup
description: While on my European vacation, Wes Nolte  was so kind as to arrange the UK Force.com Developer & Admin Meetup during my time in London. He has a great recap on the Tquila blog  . For such a short notice, there was a really good turnout and we had some very interesting presos on Talend and dynamic Visualforce components. I got to meet a bunch of the guys at Tquila (my new favorite UK mates!) and we attempted to put the pub out of commission but were thrown out shortly before midnight. Fortunately

<p>While on my European vacation, <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/wesnolte">Wes Nolte</a> was so kind as to arrange the UK Force.com Developer & Admin Meetup during my time in London. He has a great recap on the <a href="http://tquilamockingbird.wordpress.com/2011/06/28/post-mortem-uk-force-com-developer-admin-meetup/">Tquila blog</a>.</p>
<p>For such a short notice, there was a really good turnout and we had some very interesting presos on Talend and dynamic Visualforce components. I got to meet a bunch of the guys at Tquila (my new favorite UK mates!) and we attempted to put the pub out of commission but were thrown out shortly before midnight. Fortunately, there were a couple of more pubs open in London so we ran next door.</p>

<p>The next UK Force.com Developer & Admin Meetup is scheduled for August 2nd and Wes and <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/Anup">Anup Jadhav</a> are presenting on Team Development Strategies and Tools on the Force.com Platform. Not sure if I can make the meeting but I'll try.</p>
