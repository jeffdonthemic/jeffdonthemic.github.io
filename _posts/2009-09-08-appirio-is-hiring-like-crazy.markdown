<p>At Appirio we are always looking for bright, hardworking people. If you are interested in working on some of the coolest products for Salesforce.com and Google with companies like VMware, Salesforce.com, Dolby, Google, Dolby, Honeywell and DeVry University, then <a href="/contact/">drop me a line</a>. We are always looking for developers, project managers and sales people.</p>
<p>We hire based upon the following attributes:</p>
<ol style="padding-left:25px;">
	<li>Trust</li>
	<li>Professionalism</li>
	<li>Smarts</li>
</ol>
We are not necessarily looking for Salesforce.com experts. It's great to have experience with Salesforce.com, but you just have to be smart and willing to learn. We have alot of people that come from other technology consulting backgrounds including PeopleSoft, Siebel, SAP, etc.
<p>If you are interested in talking about the opportunities at Appirio, <a href="/contact/">drop me a line</a> and I'd be glad to talk with you. If you want to get started in the interview I can provide that information as well.</p>
<p>Sorry if this sounds like a commercial for the Army... "Be all you can with Appirio"!</p>
