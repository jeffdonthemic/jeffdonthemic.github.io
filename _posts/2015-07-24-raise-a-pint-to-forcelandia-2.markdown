<p>Yesterday I spoke at the first annual <a href="http://www.forcelandia.com">Forcelandia</a> conference in Portland, OR sponsored by the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Portland-Salesforce-Developer-Group/">Portland Salesforce Developer User Group</a>. Angela Mahoney and Larry Latimer put on a great event that will sure to be back next year. Keep your eyes out for it.</p>

<p>Not only was the event hosted by <a href="http://widmerbrothers.com/">Widmer Brothers Brewing</a> but it was coincidently (I think not!) during <a href="http://www.oregonbrewfest.com/">Oregon BeerFest</a>.</p>

<p>The food was great and beer was flowing throughout much of the day. Eventhough they werent scheduled to start serving beer till lunch, I insisted on having a beer in my hand for my 10:15am talk. Since Im from the east coast I deemed it totally acceptable since it was already 1:15pm at home. Past experience has shown me that I always sound much better after the audience has had a couple of beers.</p>
<p>Not only did we get a private tour of the brewery, as an extra bonus everyone received free passes to BrewFest afterwards! So essentially the conference moved to BrewFest after it officially ended.</p>

<p>The event was sponsored by <a href="http://www.appirio.com">Appirio</a>, <a href="http://www.salesforce.com">Salesforce</a> and <a href="http://cloudbilt.com/">MapAnything by Cloudbilt</a> with a number of Salesforce staff and community MVPs flying in for the event.</p>
<p>THE <a href="https://twitter.com/petercoffee">Peter Coffee</a> kicked off the conference with his keynote on raising the platform. We had a demo on Wave, a beer themed talk on JavaScript for Force.com, a walkthrough of Apex test strategies, an overview of <a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/trailhead">Trailhead</a> and a number of Admin talks.</p>

<p>I spoke on one of my favorite topic, using Heroku for Salesforce projects. <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/jeffdonthemic/forcelandia-2015">Heres the deck</a> if youd like to take a peek.</p>
<p>I also <a href="https://www.topcoder.com/challenge-details/30050892/?type=develop">launched a special topcoder challenge</a> for all attendees with my favorite API, <a href="https://untappd.com/">Untappd</a>. The challenge is more of a hackathon to build the coolest app possible with the Untappd API. I worked with the guys from Untappd to expedite the API access approval process so that developers can get to work quicker. I'll blog about the result in a couple of weeks.</p>
