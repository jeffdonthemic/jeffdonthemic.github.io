title:  Force.com Toolkit for Facebook Updates
description:  In case you havent noticed Im a huge proponent (and fanboy) of the Force.com Toolkit for Facebook and of Facebook in general.

<p>Last week salesforce.com <a href="http://blog.sforce.com/sforce/2011/02/new-facebook-toolkit-now-available.html" target="_blank">officially released</a> the beta version of the toolkit. If you haven't already done so, you should definitely <a href="https://login.salesforce.com/?startURL=%2Fpackaging%2FinstallPackage.apexp%3Fp0%3D04t50000000EbVC" target="_blank">install it from here</a> (it's an unmanaged package) and start playing around with it. It's not quite ready for production (hence the beta tag) as the JSON parser needs to be native on the platform. The parser should be available in Summer '11 (safe harbor).</p>
<p>Quinton wrote a great <a href="http://wiki.developerforce.com/index.php/Getting_Started_with_the_Force.com_Toolkit_for_Facebook" target="_blank">Getting Started</a> article that includes virtually everything you need to get up and running quickly. I'm actually working on a Facebook Canvas app with the toolkit for a top secret Appirio project that will be released in the next week or so. I'm actually doing wall posts in my app but the toolkit currently doesn't support writes to Facebook. Luckily I can <a href="https://github.com/developerforce/Force.com-Toolkit-for-Facebook" target="_blank">fork the project at GitHub</a> and eventually add this code to the toolkit if Quinton blesses it. Feel free to fork the project as well and make your own additions or modifications. I'm sure Quinton would love the input.</p>
<p>There's also a really interesting article over at ReadWriteCloud entitled, <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/cloud/2011/02/salesforcecom-has-launched-its.php" target="_blank">Salesforce.com and Facebook Strengthen Ties Through Force.com Platform</a>, that makes some references to the relationship between Facebook and salesforce.com. I know that <a href="http://www.embracingthecloud.com" target="_blank">Mike Leach</a> is at Facebook working on the salesforce.com team so he's evangalizing the platform inside Facebook. I'm sure there's more good stuff to come.</p>
