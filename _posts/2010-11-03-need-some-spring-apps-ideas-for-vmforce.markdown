title:  Need Some Spring Apps Ideas for VMforce!
description: So a few months ago I promised to put together a Spring / Chatter / App Engine demo that could be possibly ported to VMforce. Since our Handbook  is off to the printers, Im back to doing fun stuff!  Im looking for some ideas for a demo project that you typically wouldnt do natively on the Force.com platform that you would like to eventually see on VMforce. Perhaps a customer facing Java app with a jQuery front end for HR, eCommerce or whatever. Please send me your ideas!
