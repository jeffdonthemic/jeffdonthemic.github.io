title:  Amazon's EC2 Console Makes Cloud Computing Fun and Easy
description: The new Amazon EC2 Console is a slick point-and-click, web-based user interface providing access to Amazons suite of infrastructure web services. AWS has typically been a geek service due to its command line interface, but this new console should attract new (Windows) customers that are more confortable with a point-and-click interface.
