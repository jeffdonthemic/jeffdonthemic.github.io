<p>I <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/blog/2015/08/how-simple-text-app-mavericks.html">recently recorded an App Maverick interview</a> for Salesforce with Meredith Flynn-Ripley, CEO and Founder of <a href="http://www.heywire.com/">HeyWire</a>, for a walkthrough of Heywires apps, <a href="http://www.heywire.com/products/business-messenger/#.Vc3rR1NViko">LiveText Agent and Business Messenger</a>.</p>
<p>I've been doing SMS integration for Salesforce for years but HeyWire has some great features that make for a complete SMS conversation in Salesforce.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>HeyWire adds text features to a companys existing 1-800 or office numbers so that texts come from a number that customers are familiar with and are more likely to engage with.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With the LiveText Agent, customer service reps can text customers from within the Salesforce Service Cloud, allowing them to pull up each customers case history while messaging.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>According to Flynn-Ripley, HeyWire customers observed a 32% spike in close rates when responding to inbound Web inquiries via the app, while customer satisfaction scores increased an average of 50 to 60% in the first two months after launching HeyWire.</p>
