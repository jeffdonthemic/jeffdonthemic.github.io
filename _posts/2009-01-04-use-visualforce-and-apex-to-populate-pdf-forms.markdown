title:  Use Visualforce and Apex to Populate PDF Forms
description: Somehow I missed this post on generating PDFs  , but in addition creating PDFs from scratch using Apex, you can also populate third-party forms (IRS forms for instance) using Adobes XFDF format. We are currently using Teleriks .NET Reporting services (C#/ASP.NET) but this may be another route to investigate depending upon how much control this provides the developer.
