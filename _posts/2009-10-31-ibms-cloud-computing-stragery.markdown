title:  IBM's Cloud Computing Stragery
description: Kyle Roche  posted this video for theAppirio Cloud Computing video challenge. It has an amazingly funny and incoherent interview with an IBM employee from their vendor booth at last years Dreamforce. I think Kyles strategy to win the contest is to overwhelm the judges with the sheer number of his videos. Appirio  is giving away $5000 for the best cloud computing video!
