<p>Not a lot of details were given (including pricing) but the following bullet points are available from <a href="http://forta.com/blog/index.cfm/2009/8/12/ColdFusion-9-And-Cloud-Computing" target="_blank">Ben Forta's site</a>:</p>
<ul>
 <li>The current CPU based ColdFusion licensing, including no restriction on instances or virtual servers, remains as is in ColdFusion 9.</li>
 <li>ColdFusion will introduce new licensing options for cloud environments, where there is no per CPU model. ColdFusion Standard will allow a single cloud instance, and ColdFusion Enterprise will allow up to 10 cloud instances.</li>
 <li>Split licenses won't be allowed, so no ColdFusion Enterprise running on 1 CPU and 5 cloud instances.</li>
 <li>Plan to support<a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">Amazon EC2</a> by creating ready-to-use<a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/#functionality">Amazon Machine Images</a> (AMIs).</li>
</ul>
I'm not sure how earth-shattering this is given the amount of details but we'll surely know more soon.
