I've met with a number of the Mobile PMs and some of the marketing guys for the event. After a couple of demos I was invited to work the Campground showing off the app. I've heard from our marketing guys that Marc is actually the one that spotted my video when I posted it. Apparently he has a Google Alert set up for "chatter" and "android" or something.</p><p style="clear: both">I've slimmed down the Android app a bit for Cloudforce and made some enhancements requested by the marketing department. I'll try to post a video of the new app shortly and some of the challenges I faced. A few people have emailed me with questions so there is some interest out there in the interwebs.</p><p style="clear: both"><a href="http://old.jeffdouglas.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/promote-button1.png" class="image-link"><img class="linked-to-original" src="http://res.cloudinary.com/blog-jeffdouglas-com/image/upload/v1401030314/y5srewgpbizageg0ave5.png" height="40" align="left" width="67" style=" display: inline; float: left; margin: 0 10px 10px 0;" /></a>If you haven't already done so, <a href="http://developer.force.com/chatterdevchallenge/entry?id=087300000002lGFAAY" target="_blank">PLEASE VOTE</a> for my Salesforce Chatter for Android app!!</p><p style="clear: both"></p><br class="final-break" style="clear: both" />
