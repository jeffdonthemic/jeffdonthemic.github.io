title:  Developing Apps with the Adobe Flash Builder for Force.com
description: Ive been doing a lot of work the past couple of weeks with the new Adobe Flash Builder for Force.com  and the new Stratus framework. Im in the putting together a fairly large Adobe Air demo and an accompanying blog post. In the meantime I ported a small app from Flex 3 to the new Adobe Flash Builder for Force.com and did a small screencast of some new functionality. It was a demo that I did of a way to provide a graphical representation of an floor layout (warehouse, real estate, floorplan, etc.

<p>I've been doing a lot of work the past couple of weeks with the new <a href="http://developer.force.com/flashbuilder">Adobe Flash Builder for Force.com</a> and the new Stratus framework. I'm in the putting together a fairly large Adobe Air demo and an accompanying blog post. In the meantime I ported a small app from Flex 3 to the new Adobe Flash Builder for Force.com and did a small screencast of some new functionality. It was a demo that I did of a way to provide a graphical representation of an floor layout (warehouse, real estate, floorplan, etc.) and show how to tie the elements to distinct records in Salesforce.com.</p>
