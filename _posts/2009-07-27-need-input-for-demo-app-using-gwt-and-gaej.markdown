<p>A couple of the guys and myself at Appirio are writing a beginning Google App Engine with Java book to be released this fall. We've locked down the functionality of the app we are going to be discussing in the book but I would like to put the app out to everyone and get any feedback regarding the user interaction.</p>
<p><strong>You can run the application at: </strong><a href="http://book-timeentry.appspot.com/" target="_blank"><strong>http://book-timeentry.appspot.com</strong></a></p>
<p><a href="http://book-timeentry.appspot.com/"><img title="timecard-app" src="http://res.cloudinary.com/blog-jeffdouglas-com/image/upload/v1400928442/zkrvybtuufoigxx8jw3z.png" alt="timecard-app" width="544" height="235" /></a></p>
<p>The use case is fairly simple. This is a time card application where users login with their Google credentials and enter time against a project and milestone. The user's time is persisted to BigTable and can be viewed by selecting the "Current Entries" tab.</p>
<p>Please let me know if you have any issues, recommendation or general feedback on functionality. This is a beginners level book so the app won't go into too much depth. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.</p>
