title:  Session Recap - Connect Your Clouds with Force.com
description:  Dreamforce 11 is over and I can finally catch my breath. Despite the un-godly start time of 8-30am Friday morning, my session went fairly well. I had a good turnout and some interesting questions. Ive posted the PDF of my deck to the sessions Chatter group, but it may be easier to access them from my blog. Here is the PDF and PPT version of my presentation along with the source code .
