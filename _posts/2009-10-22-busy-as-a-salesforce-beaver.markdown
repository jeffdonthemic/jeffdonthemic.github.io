title:  Busy as a Salesforce Beaver
description: A couple of people have asked me if Im dead since my blog has been rather light for the last week or so. I actually have a full-time job and unfortunately that is getting in the way of my blogging. Work at Appirio is quite busy as I just wrapped up one of the first rollouts of our newProfessional Services Enterprise  (PS Enterprise) product for a large Salesforce.com customer in Austin last week. We were replacing Open Air and working with a 1.0 release of PS Enterprise so things were new, fresh

<p>A couple of people have asked me if I'm dead since my blog has been rather light for the last week or so. I actually have a full-time job and unfortunately that is getting in the way of my blogging.</p>
<p>Work at Appirio is quite busy as I just wrapped up one of the first rollouts of our new<a href="http://www.appirio.com/products/SvcsResource_PSE.php" target="_blank">Professional Services Enterprise</a> (PS Enterprise) product for a large Salesforce.com customer in Austin last week. We were replacing Open Air and working with a 1.0 release of PS Enterprise so things were new, fresh and exciting. I'm now on a new SFA project for one of the largest non-profits in the world based out of Washington, DC. We just finished a Google Apps conversion with them and now are implementing Salesforce CRM. We got a head-start on the project by using the <a href="http://wiki.developerforce.com/index.php/Nonprofit_Starter_Pack" target="_blank">Nonprofit Starter Pack</a>.</p>
<p>Appirio is into full-swing Dreamforce mode and in addition to <a href="/2009/10/21/attend-dreamforce-09-hands-on-training/" target="_blank">working at the two hands-on training sessions</a>, I am getting ready for my own presentation, "Architecting in the Cloud: Choosing the Right Technologies for Your Solution" on Friday, Nov. 20 @ 11:30AM. My preso deck is almost done and we are just polishing up the slides with Dave Carroll.</p>
<p>I'm also putting the finishing touches on my book <a href="http://links.jeffdouglas.com/book" target="_blank">Beginning Java Google App Engine</a> with my buddy<a href="http://www.kyleroche.com/" target="_blank">Kyle Roche</a> (BTW... Kyle is much smarter than I am and is the real brains behind the book). It looks like we are going to miss the Dreamforce release date but it will be available by Christmas. Hopefully we'll have some propaganda to distribute at our booth during <a href="http://www.salesforce.com/dreamforce/DF09/site/" target="_blank">Dreamforce</a>.</p>
