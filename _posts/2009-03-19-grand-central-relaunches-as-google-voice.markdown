<p>Google is at it again. They are giving me more services for free. I hate those guys! &lt;g&gt; I've been a Grand Central subscriber for the last couple of years and love the services. All of my voice communications on the web, great call screening and group management features.</p>
<p>Google <a href="http://googlevoiceblog.blogspot.com/2009/03/moving-to-google-voice.html" target="_blank">just announced</a> that they are relaunching the service as <a href="http://voice.google.com" target="_blank">Google Voice</a>. They are adding cool features like automatic transcriptions of your voicemails, SMS support and conference calling.</p>
<p>Google Voice is currently open to Grand Central subscribers only but you can leave your email to be notified when they are accepting new subscribers.</p>
