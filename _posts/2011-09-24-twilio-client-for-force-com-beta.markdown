title:  Twilio Client for Force.com BETA
description:   Twilio just released a new beta version of their Apex toolkit. You can fork it here on GitHub . It includes some new stuff, mainly the Capabilities class for Twilio Client. The majority of it was written by Kyle Roche so its pretty top notch stuff. If you are interested in getting your hands dirty with the new toolkit, we have a Twilio Client for Salesforce Customer Portal development challenge over at CloudSpokes with $1000 up for grabs.
