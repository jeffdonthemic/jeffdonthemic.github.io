title:  Writing a New Developer Book for Google Wave
description:  Now that our Beginning Java for Google App Engine book has gone to print, Kyle Roche and I have signed an agreement with Apress to write a Google Wave book targeted at developers titled, Programming Google Wave. If you have any suggestions on what you would like to see, please let us know as we have no idea what to write . Seriously, weve got some great sample robots and extensions for Python and Java but could always use some ideas. Please post your ideas or comments below or on Kyles site !
