title:  Chatter Bot Wins!! Congratulations Mike Leach!
description: So I attended the hackathon last night at Cloudforce 2010 in San Jose where they  announced the results of the Chatter Developer Challenge. My buddy Mike Leach  walked away with the Grand Prize! His Chatter Bot  ruled the day and beat my Chatter for Android  app (I came in 2nd). Mike clearly deserved to win the contest. Not only did his entry use various aspects of Chatter but he did it in manner that was unique to everyone. At Appirio we thought it was so a great idea that we wrote a blog post

Mike clearly deserved to win the contest. Not only did his entry use various aspects of Chatter but he did it in manner that was unique to everyone. At Appirio we thought it was so a great idea that <a href="http://blog.appirio.com/2010/06/things-chatters-too.html" target="_blank">we wrote a blog post</a> about how "things" can chatter.</p><p style="clear: both"><br />If you haven't had a chance to view his <a href="http://www.embracingthecloud.com/2010/06/07/ChatterBotForSalesforce.aspx" target="_blank">Chatter Bot video</a> you should definitely do so now. Also, make sure you <a href="http://www.embracingthecloud.com" target="_blank">subscribe to his blog</a> as he has a ton of great Salesforce info. He's on the top of my blogroll.</p><p style="clear: both">I'd also like to thank everyone at Salesforce for throwing such a great party last night and really good developer event in general. The challenge had a ton of great Chatter apps and they gave away some substantial swag. Thanks again to Dana, Nick, Jon, Quinton, Reid, Umit, Andrew, Nick and Sati. Ron Hess and Dave Carroll even showed up so it was a star-studded event.</p><p style="clear: both">If you didn't get a chance to attend Cloudforce this year I would highly recommend you <strong>not</strong> miss it next time. It's a much more laid back, intimate event in comparison to Dreamforce. There are plenty of changes to interact with PMs and Evangelists to ask questions and provide feedback. </p><br class="final-break" style="clear: both" />
