<p>After Labor Day I'll be joining the Salesforce Developer Relations team as the new Trailhead Developer Advocate! Is this a dream job? <strong>Yes!</strong> Am I super-excited? <strong>Yes!</strong></p>

<p>I've always been a huge fan of sites like Codeacademy and Code School that reinforce teaching by letting you code right in your browser. I even <a href="/2014/11/03/apex-algorithm-challenges-for-force-com/">started to build my own Apex learning resource</a> shortly before last Dreamforce but I saw the shining light of Trailhead and knew it was a force to be reckoned with.</p>
<p>So what will I be doing in my new role? Among other things, I'm going to ...</p>

<p>It was <strong>extremely</strong> tough leaving <a href="http://www.appirio.com">Appirio</a> after helping it grow for the last 6 years. It's a fantastic company and I have a lot of great friends there that I'll stay in contact with. However, I couldn't pass up this opportunity at Salesforce. The possibilities with Trailhead are endless. I joked with Sandeep Bhanot, my new boss, that I thought he'd written the job specifically for me. It was spot-on. I've known almost everyone on the dev relations team for years so I'm excited to be part of a group that is dedicated to helping developers build incredible application with Salesforce.</p>
<p>I'll still be blogging and developing all sorts of crazy stuff on my personal blog so stayed tuned. The fun will continue. However, most of my content will probably be appearing on Trailhead or the <a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/blogs/developer-relations/">Developer Relations blog</a>.</p>
<p>We have a number of Trailhead announcements at Dreamforce so hang on cause it's going to be a wild ride that will just keep getting bigger and better!</p>
