You can now set up entitlement management so that your support reps can verify if your customers are eligible for support, create and maintain service contracts, specify service levels on a per customer basis and enforcement of service levels with time-dependent, automated processes. There is a TON of stuff around Entitlement Management including service contracts and milestones so definitely take a closer look!</p><p style="clear: both"><strong>Quotes - Sales Cloud</strong><br />A quote is a record showing proposed prices for products and services created from an opportunity and its products. You can create a set of quotes to show different combinations of products, discounts, and quantities so customers can compare prices. Each opportunity can have multiple associated quotes, and any one of them can be synced with the opportunity. You can also create and email PDF quotes.</p><p style="clear: both"><strong>Answers - Service Cloud</strong><br />Answers is the newest feature of the Community application that lets community members ask questions, post replies, and vote whether they like or dislike a reply. It looks somewhat similar to Ideas in such that you assign categories to communities and then enable Answers for the customer and partner portals.</p><p style="clear: both"><strong>Knowledge Enhancements - Service Cloud</strong><br />A ton on Knowledge enhancements including new API objects for articles, metadata components for data category groups, describe calls for data categories, SOQL and SOSL filter, field level security for articles, custom report types and access to articles in the partner portal.</p><p style="clear: both"><strong>SOQL Enhancements</strong></p><p style="clear: both"><em>New GROUP BY Clause</em><br />SELECT LeadSource, COUNT(Name) FROM Lead GROUP BY LeadSource</p><p style="clear: both"><em>New HAVING Clause</em><br />SELECT Name, Count(Id) FROM Account GROUP BY Name HAVING Count(Id) > 1</p><p style="clear: both"><em>Aggregate Functions (Finally!!!!)</em><br />SOQL now supports AVG(), COUNT(), COUNT_DISTINCT(), MIN(), MAX(), and SUM()</p><p style="clear: both"><em>Date Functions</em><br />A slew of new date functions for SOQL to make your life easier.</p><p style="clear: both"><em>Semi-Join and Anti-Join Support For Reference Fields</em><br />I ran into the issue all the time when writing queries.

However, there's still a general limit on heap size. What!!??</em></strong></li><li>sObjects are now created as Objects and you can create generic sObject collections: Set<sobject> foo = new Set<sobject>();</li><li>I'm don't this this is what Taggert was talking about during his DF09 presentation, but there are a lot of new logging features to check out on line 121.

For example, in addition to defining a two-object master-detail relationship, such as AccountExpense Report, you can extend the relationship to subdetail records, such as AccountExpense ReportExpense Line Item. You can then perform operations across the masterdetailsubdetail relationship. There are some caveats so check out the details.</p><p style="clear: both"><strong>Sandbox to ProductionChange Sets Beta</strong><br />Use change sets to move configuration changes via a web interface.
