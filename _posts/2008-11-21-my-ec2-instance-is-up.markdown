description: I finally got around to getting my EC2 instance up and running . I debated upon using an Open BlueDragon, Windows 2003 or Railo AMI. I finally decided upon the Railo image after a collegue (you know who you are) spoke highly about Railo. I found a really  good tutorial on setting up EC2 so it only took me an hour or so to get up and running. It was surprisingly easy after getting my AWS keys issues and the command line tools installed. I dont have alot of experience with Linux (Ive played around

<p>I don't have alot of experience with Linux (I've played around with Red Hat and Ubuntu) so sometimes the simple tasks are the most painful as I don't know all of the SSH commands.</p>
<p>My next task is to setup (or start?) an FTP service and then configure a new website. I'm think about moving my jeffdouglas.com domain to this server.</p>
