<p>You can find the <a href="https://github.com/jeffdonthemic/df13-force-api">source code that I used for my demo app at this repo</a>. Feel free to pick it apart and send me any questions you might have. The <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/jeffdonthemic/force-api">slides are on Slideshare</a> for your viewing pleasure. I heard that the theatre sessions were going to be recorded this time but I'm not sure of that.</p>
