title:  Sayonara WordPress. Hola Ghost!
description: If the DNS has propagated successfully you should be seeing my new Ghost  blog now and Im super excited about it! Ive always hated WordPress (Im not the only one  ) for a number of reasons (expensive, bloated, slow, PITA, etc) but its always been a necessary evil. My main complaint with WordPress is that its trying to be everything for everyone. I dont want an application platform. I want a blog. This is why I love Ghost! Its just a blogging platform and its written in Node.js using Handlebars.

<p>If the DNS has propagated successfully you should be seeing my new <a href="http://www.ghost.org">Ghost</a> blog now and I'm super excited about it! I've always hated WordPress (<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=why+i+hate+wordpress&oq=why+i+hate+wordpress&aqs=chrome..69i57j0.3102j1j7&sourceid=chrome&es_sm=91&ie=UTF-8">I'm not the only one</a>) for a number of reasons (expensive, bloated, slow, PITA, etc) but it's always been a necessary evil. My main complaint with WordPress is that it's trying to be everything for everyone. I don't want an application platform. I want a blog. This is why I love Ghost! It's "just a blogging platform" and it's written in Node.js using Handlebars. FTW!!</p>

<p>There are a number of reasons to love Ghost:</p>
<ol>
<li>It's all Node.js and Handlebars so I can easily muck around in it. For both of my Ghost sites, I purchased a template (I can't do design) and hacked the crap out of it. I even wrote <a href="/search">this search page</a> from scratch.</li>
<li>Themes are cheap, clean, fast and mobile friendly.</li>
<li>Easy and cheap to stand up! I can get a new blog up and running in (literally) a matter of minutes with hosted sites using <a href="http://www.ghost.io">ghost.io</a> or <a href="http://www.digitalocean.com">digitalocean</a> for a handful of presidents a month.</li>
<li>It's Node.js so I can run it locally for development and testing.</li>
</ol>
<p>I will admit that it's not 100% baked as of right now. But that's awesome!! The community has time to build some killer blogging plugins. The next version of Ghost should include a CLI so going to be a huge milestone for admins.</p>
