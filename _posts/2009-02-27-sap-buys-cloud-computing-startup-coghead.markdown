title:  SAP Buys Cloud Computing Startup Coghead
description: I just ran across this  and found it quite interesting. I was a Coghead beta tester and found their software quite unique. Apparently they either couldnt find a niche or their timing was a little premature. Perhaps the market is not quite ripe for a mass-market-end-user-build-your-own-software. Since SAP is having problems with the CRM adoptions it will be interesting to see how (if) they integrate Coghead into their stack.
