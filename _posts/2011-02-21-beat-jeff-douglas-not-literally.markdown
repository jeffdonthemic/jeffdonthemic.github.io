title:  Beat Jeff Douglas ... not literally
description:  Over at CloudSpokes  we have a newBeat Jeff Douglas contest . The contest is not to see if you can physically beat me up, although that was suggested by a couple of people that I work with, but to see if you can write a better browser plugin that me. The title doesnt fit the project well, but its Narinders way to poke some fun at me and at the same time to get some work done.

The contest is not to see if you can physically beat me up, although that was suggested by a couple of people that I work with, but to see if you can write a better browser plugin that me. The title doesn't fit the project well, but it's Narinder's way to poke some fun at me and at the same time to get some work done.</p>
<p>A while ago I wrote a <a href="/force-com-utility-belt/" target="_blank">Google Chrome extension with a number of salesforce.com tools</a> and it's been wildly popular. The only problem is that (apparently) not everyone uses Chrome. Some people still use Firefox (I do as well for multiple orgs, BTW). I received a large number of emails asking when a Firefox extension would be available.</p>
<p>So the <a href="http://www.cloudspokes.com/challenge_detail.html?contestID=127" target="_blank">"Beat Jeff Douglas" contest</a> is actually to create a Firefox plugin of my Force.com Utility Belt. The <span style="color:red">prize for the contest is $1000</span> so that should be a great incentive. The Firefox plugin shouldn't be too difficult as it's mainly Javascript and I've attached my Chrome source code to the contest. You just have to know how to make a plugin for Firefox and you could bring home the bacon (<a href="http://homecooking.about.com/od/foodhistory/a/baconhistory.htm" target="_blank">historical reference</a> for @wesnolte).</p>
<p><strong>So what are you waiting for? Head over to <a href="http://www.cloudspokes.com/challenge_detail.html?contestID=127" target="_blank">CloudSpokes</a>, use my source code and write a Firefox plugin and win $1000! </strong></p>
