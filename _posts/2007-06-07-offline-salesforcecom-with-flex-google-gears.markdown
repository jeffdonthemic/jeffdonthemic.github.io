title:  Offline SalesForce.com with Flex & Google Gears
description: I blogged just a few days ago about Google Gears and already there are Flex applications popping up utilizing the new API. Christophe Coenraets has an interesting blog post  of an offline SalesForce.com application written in Flex (an Apollo version is also available) that uses the Google Gears Database API to save data to an embedded SQLite database, and the LocalServer API to enable offline access to the application. The source code is available for your viewing pleasure.
