</ul>
SAP <a href="http://www.v3.co.uk/v3/news/2249413/sap-gives-update-business" target="_blank">gave an update</a> a couple of days ago at a London event. Some of the problems Business ByDesign is dealing with include:
<ul>
	<li>Scalability issues - all customers run on their own blade servers</li>
	<li>Overly "feature-rich" - the suite was originally designed to meet all of the needs of its customer base instead of focusing on specific functionality</li>
	<li>Lack of corporate commitment - SAP is cutting R&D funding and shifting resources to other products</li>
	<li>Runs on NetWeaver - a full instance is too heavy for a SaaS application and finding "cloud developers" who have full Java EE stack experience may be tough</li>
</ul>
I worked at an SAP consulting company in the last 4-5 years of the dotcom era. At that time, SAP was pounded for not exposing core functionality via web services thus maintaining a silo of corporate data. In a couple of years SAP turn that giant freighter around and exposed almost everything via NetWeaver. SAP is a 1000 lbs gorilla but when it decides to do something, it may take awhile, but it becomes a force to be reckoned with.
<p>However, 1-2 years in internet-time is forever. New markets may come and go in that time frame. SAP needs to become more agile if it wants to compete in the cloud space. SAP <a href="/2009/02/27/sap-buys-cloud-computing-startup-coghead/" target="_blank">bought Coghead</a> earlier this year but there seems to be no mention of how its technology is being utilized.</p>
<p>Can SAP pull off "cloud computing"? Â How does a company that has thrived for so long on an on-premise, high-margin, maintenance-fee model, move customers to a hosted, low-cost, user-licensed model without going bankrupt? I'd hate to be the marketing team in Waldorf.</p>
