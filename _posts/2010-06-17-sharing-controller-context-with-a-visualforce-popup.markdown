title:  Sharing Controller Context with a Visualforce Popup
description: How do I popup a dialog in Visualforce.  Im not sure what the deal is but this week Ive received 3 emails asking me how to open a Visualforce popop window from a Visualforce page but both  running in the same session. The question is asked fairly often on the message boards but there isnt a native solution.  The use case is that you have a Visualforce page with a commandbutton that launches a Visualforce popup. You want the popup to be able to access the controllers context so you can share stat

You want the popup to be able to access the controller's context so you can share state. Unfortunately this is not currently possible with Visualforce and Apex. Opening a new window will start a new request which initializes a new instance of the controller. You <em>could</em> pass some variables to the new controller via Javascript but making a callback to the opening Visualforce is tedious as best.</p><p style="clear: both">Depending on what your popup needs to do, the best solution might be to create a modal instead of a new Visualforce page. Dave Carroll has a great article titled, "<a href="http://wiki.developerforce.com/index.php/Visualforce_Popup" target="_blank">Modal Dialogs in Visualforce using the Yahoo! User Interface Library</a>", that shows how to use an In-Page DIV or Hidden DIV to create the modal. You can probably accomplish the same effect with other libraries but Dave's solution with <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/" target="_blank">YUI!</a> is straight-forward, simple and well documented.</p><br class="final-break" style="clear: both" />
