title:  Phantom Search Results
description:  Ive received a number of emails over the past months regarding phantom searches showing up in Google for content that doesnt exist on my blog. Unfortunately I installed a Wordpress plugin that automatically submitted all search results for my blog to Google. I uninstalled the plugin about a month ago but it appears that the search results still exist. If anyone has info/strategies for getting these removed, I would greatly appreciate the feedback.
