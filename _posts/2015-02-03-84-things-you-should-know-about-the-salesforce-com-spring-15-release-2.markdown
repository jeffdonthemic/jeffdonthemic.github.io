<p>The <a href="http://www.salesforce.com/customer-resources/releases/spring15/">Spring '15 Release</a> should be hitting boxes soon with 250+ new and improved features! With over 300 page of documentation there are plenty of goodies for everyone. Salesforce continues to give us what we ask for with 5 pages of features implemented from user submissions on the IdeaExchange. I'm happy to say that <a href="https://success.salesforce.com/ideaView?id=08730000000kmjRAAQ">one of them</a> was mine!</p>
<p>Of course there are a ton in the <a href="http://www.salesforce.com/customer-resources/releases/spring15/">release notes</a>, but I've pulled out my favorites in this handy-dandy list. There will be no test afterwards so peruse at your leisure.</p>
<h2 id="generalenhancements">General Enhancements</h2>
<ul>
<li>IE 7 & 8 are no longer supported. Good riddance I say!</li>
<li>Duplicate Alerts and Blocking allows you to control whether and when you allow users to create duplicate records inside Salesforce (does not require a Data.com license BTW).</li>
<li>Improved "Import My Accounts & Contacts" from social data sources.</li>

<li>Flexible Pages have been renamed Lightning Pages throughout the Salesforce documentation and user interface. They are still known as FlexiPages in the API, however.</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="forcecomcodeenhancements">Force.com 'Code' Enhancements</h2>
<ul>
<li>Deploy to production without running all tests with Quick Deploy. You can now deploy components to production by skipping the execution of all Apex tests for components that have been validated within the last four days (that sound you just heard was me falling off my chair).</li>
<li>New Visualforce attributes for <a href="flow:interview">flow:interview</a></li>
<li>Visualforce map component displays locations more precisely.</li>
<li>The URLFOR function has been optimized for use with attachments in Visualforce.</li>

<li>Use asynchronous callouts to make long-running requests from a Visualforce page to an external Web service and process responses with callback methods (aka, Long-Running Callouts).</li>
