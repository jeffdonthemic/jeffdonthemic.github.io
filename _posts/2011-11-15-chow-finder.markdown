<p>Chow Finder is a mobile application for services members to easily locate dining facilities, aka "chow halls", on any military installation. It was inspired by my sons in the Army and Navy who are always looking for their next meal.</p>
<p>The application was written using <a href="http://jquerymobile.com/">jQuery Mobile</a> and <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>. I used <a href="http://database.com">Database.com</a> for the data store and it is hosted on <a href="http://www.heroku.com">Heroku</a>. All of this for free!</p>
<p>You can run the <a href="http://chow-finder.herokuapp.com">Chow Finder here</a> or <a href="https://github.com/jeffdonthemic/Chow-Finder">fork the code at GitHub</a>. I'm still working on some loose ends.</p>
