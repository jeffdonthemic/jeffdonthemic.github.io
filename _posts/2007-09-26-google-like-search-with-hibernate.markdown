<p>JBoss.org just <a href="http://labs.jboss.com/announcement/" target="_blank">released Hibernate Search 3.0</a>, which brings full text search capabilities to Hibernate-based applications.</p>
<p>Key features in Hibernate Search 3.0 include:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Transparent index synchronization: This feature eliminates the need to manually update the index on data change. Events generated by Hibernate Core will trigger the update transparently for the application.</li>
 <li>Seamless integration with the Hibernate and Java Persistence query model: Hibernate Search embraces both the Hibernate and Java Persistence semantic and APIs. As a result, switching from a Hibernate Query Language (HQL) query to a full text query requires minimal changes to the application.</li>
 <li>Out-of-the-box asynchronous clustering mode: Handles clustered applications, this out of the box mode also handles gracefully indexing load peaks, avoiding any contention on the online system.</li>
 <li>Product extensibility: Developers can extend Hibernate Search with a series of extension points for deep index interaction customization that helps edge case applications meet their performance and architectural requirements and constraints.</li>
</ul>
