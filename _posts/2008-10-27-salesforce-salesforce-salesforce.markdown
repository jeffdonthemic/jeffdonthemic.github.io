description: Im in Boston for the week attending the Salesforce.com DEV-501 Visualforce, Apex and DaasS training class. It should be an interesting week as I arrive back home late Saturday night and then fly out again the next morning bright and early for Dreamforce in San Francisco for 4 days. Will be tough to get an actual work done.
