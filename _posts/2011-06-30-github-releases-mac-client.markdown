title:  GitHub Releases Mac Client
description: Everyone loves GitHub but the CLI can be a little intimating for newcomers. A couple of days ago GitHub released a client for OS X . The setup walks you through the process of creating a GitHub account (if you dont have one), uploading repositories and provides a slick little interface for cloning, browsing and managing repos. If you are on Mac, be sure to download the app and give if a whirl. Salesforce.com is using GitHub more and more so starting getting up to speed on it.
