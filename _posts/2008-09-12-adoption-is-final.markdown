title:  Adoption is Final!!
description: After 2+ long years, Kiras adoption is finally complete! We had the ceremony at the court house today and about 20+ family and friends showed up (except for Scott as he couldnt make it from Gainesville). During the ceremony the judge let us take a couple of minutes to exchange rings with the immediate members of the family. The judge looked genuinely happy and said these were his favorite days at work.
