<p>It the new year again and time for resolutions. I made a resolution about a year ago to learn ruby. If you are looking for something to learn this year I would recommend ruby and here's why:</p>
<ol>
<li>Salesforce.com bought Heroku for $220M</li>
<li>Salesforce.com has been pushing "Open. Social. Mobile" for quite some time.</li>
<li>Ruby is great for creating social and mobile apps with open source technologies.</li>
</ol>
<p>Do you see a correlation here? There are big things ahead for Force.com developers using Heroku. Eventhough Heroku is a <a href="http://blog.heroku.com/archives/2011/8/3/polyglot_platform/">polyglot platform</a>, it shines with ruby. If you have the time, add ruby to your toolbox.</p>
<p>I presented this topic today at an Appirio Continuing Education webinar and thought it might come in handy to other trying to learn ruby. In the video I build a small app that displays a list of accounts, the details for a selected account and then queries for accounts by keyword. I reference some links to help you get started with ruby and rails and I've added them after the video.</p>
