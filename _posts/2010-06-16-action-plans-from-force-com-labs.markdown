Reid Carlberg (THE Apps Evangelist) sent me a private link to the app last month to test it out and I was certainly glad he did.

These tasks can be independent or dependent tasks that you can customize per user, team or for your entire organization.</p><p style="clear: both">I'm currently use it to manage the international aid process for a non-profit I help out.

This is extremely easy with dependent actions, as once a task is marked as complete, the next task in the action plan is fired off automatically.</p><p style="clear: both"><a href="http://sites.force.com/appexchange/listingDetail?listingId=a0N30000003HcINEA0" target="_blank">Action Plans</a> is a free, unmanaged app from Force.com Labs so you can install it and start using it right away.</p><br class="final-break" style="clear: both" />
