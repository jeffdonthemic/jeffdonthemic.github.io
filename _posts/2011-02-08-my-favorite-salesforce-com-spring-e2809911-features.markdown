Once again, I've scoured through all 88 pages of the <a href="https://na1.salesforce.com/help/doc/en/salesforce_spring11_release_notes.pdf" target="_blank">release notes</a> and pulled out my favorite features.I didnt hit all of the items in the release notes so make sure you <a href="https://na1.salesforce.com/help/doc/en/salesforce_spring11_release_notes.pdf" target="_blank">pull up the PDF</a> and check out all of the goodies for this release. Also check out the <a href="http://developer.force.com/releases/release/Spring11" target="_blank">Spring 11 Force.com Platform Release Preview page</a> for any last minute info. I've tried to link the features below to the appropriate section in the preview site for more info.</p>
<p>There are a number of new enhancements across the platform but developers really come out ahead with this release. Last fall I named the Winter '11 release, "<em>OMG! We Love Outlook!</em>" due to the heavy emphasis on Salesforce for Outlook. I've aptly named the Spring '11 release "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8To-6VIJZRE" target="_blank">Developers! Developers! Developers!</a>". You'll see why as the article progresses.</p>

<p><strong>REST API</strong> - Develop mobile and external apps in Java, Ruby, Python, PHP etc. using the REST API as an alternative to the SOAP-basedAPI. The REST API is a simplified approach for developers, using code that is much less verbose and easy to write. <a href="http://developer.force.com/releases/release/Spring11/REST+API" target="_blank">More info here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Criteria-Based Sharing Rules</strong> - Instead of using Triggers to create and delete sharing rules, you can now declaratively create sharing rules based upon some criteria of the record (i.e. when BillingState = 'NY'). You can create criteria-based sharing rules for accounts, opportunities, cases, contacts, and custom objects. There is a limit of 10 criteria-based sharing rules per object. <a href="http://developer.force.com/releases/release/Spring11/Criteria+Based+Sharing" target="_blank">More info here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Visualforce Inline Editing</strong> - A single component, <apex:inlineEditingSupport>, provides inline editing support in your Visualforce details pages.

Inline editing is not supported for rich text areas or dependent picklists. <a href="http://developer.force.com/releases/release/Spring11/Visualforce+Inline+Editing" target="_blank">More info here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Visualforce Dynamic Bindings</strong> - This feature allows you to write generic Visualforce pages that display information about records without necessarily knowing which fields to show. Administrators/developers can create fields sets that determine at runtime the files to be displayed. Therefore, when at you need to modify the fields on a Visualforce page you simply modify the associated field set instead of modifying the Apex controller and Visualforce page. <a href="http://developer.force.com/releases/release/Spring11/Visualforce+Dynamic+Binding" target="_blank">More info here</a> along with a <a href="http://blog.sforce.com/sforce/2011/02/using-field-sets-in-spring-11.html" target="_blank">blog post</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Change Sets</strong> - This admin features allows you to package up a number of configuration changes in one org and send them to another org to be deployed. Essentially the same as deploying with the Force.com IDE but you can now give administrators (non-developers) access to install modifications from sandbox. <a href="http://developer.force.com/releases/release/Spring11/Change+Sets" target="_blank">More info here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Force.com Flow</strong> - Formerly Visual Process Manager, this is a client-side tool that allows you to design complex, robust scripting processes that you can embed in your Visualforce pages. You can also embed Flows in Visualforce pages to be used with Force.com Sites, the Customer Portal and the partner portal. This is gonna be big!! <a href="http://developer.force.com/releases/release/Spring11/Visual+Workflow" target="_blank">More info here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>System Log Console Execution Summary</strong> - The system log contains a new tab to highlight the duration and composition of a request so you can identify and isolate execution bottlenecks. There is also a new section that details the value of variables during a request. <a href="http://developer.force.com/releases/release/Spring11/System+Log+Console+Execution+Summary" target="_blank">More info here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Daily Limit on Workflow Alert Emails</strong> - To prevent abuse of email limits, the daily limit for emails sent from workflow and approval-related email alerts is 1,000 per standard Salesforce license per organization. The overall organization limit is 2 million.</p>
<p><strong>Web Service Connector</strong> - The <a href="http://code.google.com/p/sfdc-wsc/" target="_blank">WSC</a> replaces Apache Axis 1.3 as the preferred SOAP Java client framework. WSC is an open-source project and contains a command utility that generates Java source and bytecode files from WSDL files.</p>
<p><strong>New & Modified API Objects</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>LoginHistory - Represents the login history for all successful and failed login attempts for organizations and enabled portals.</li>

<p><strong>Javascript Remoting for Apex Controllers - Developer Preview</strong> -This new feature allows you to integrate Apex and Visualforce pages with JavaScript libraries. It provides support for some methods in Apex controllers to be called via Javascript using the @RemoteAction annotation. <a href="http://developer.force.com/releases/release/Spring11/JavaScript+Remoting" target="_blank">More info here</a>.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Apex Test Framework - Pilot</strong> -Run just one, a set, or all the tests in your organization. Tests are run asynchronously: start them, then go work on other things. You can then monitor the tests, add more tests to the ones that are running, or abort running tests. Once a test finishes running, you can see additional information about that test run.</p>
<p><br /><strong>ReadOnly Annotation - Pilot</strong> -The @ReadOnly annotation provides developers the ability to perform unrestricted queries against the Force.com database. The annotation removes the limit of the number of returned rows for a request but also blocks any DML statements within the request. The @ReadOnly annotation is only available for Web services and the schedulable interface.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Chatter for Mobile Browsers - Pilot</strong> -In addition to the Chatter mobile app for Apple and BlackBerry devices, salesforce.com provides a mobilized Web version of Chatter that you can access from a mobile device browser without installing an app.</p>
