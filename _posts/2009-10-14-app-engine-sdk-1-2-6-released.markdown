<p>Some cool new features were released yesterday for App Engine. :</p>
<p><strong>Incoming Emai</strong>l - You can now enable mail as an inbound service (just like XMPP) so users can email your application at <a href="mailto:whatever@yourappid.appspotmail.com">whatever@yourappid.appspotmail.com</a>. Inbound messages are converted to HTTP requests (just like XMPP) which you can receive via webhook handler.</p>
<p><strong>Delete an App</strong> - Finally you are now able to delete an app! This has been one of the top 5 most requested features on the issue tracker. I have a bunch of old apps that I need to delete from when I first started groking App Engine. One thing to note when deleting an app - the appid can never be reused after deletion.</p>
<p><strong>Datastore Stats</strong> - You can now see more detailed statistics about how your application data is stored in the Admin Console and also programmatically.</p>
