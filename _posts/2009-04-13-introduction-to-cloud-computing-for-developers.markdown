title:  An Introduction to Cloud Computing for Developers
description: Just received a tweet from Ryan Marples about a new video he posted last week. The video is targeted for .NET developers but it is applicable to anyone that wants to better understand the advantages of cloud computing from a technical perspective.  Very informative and very well done.
