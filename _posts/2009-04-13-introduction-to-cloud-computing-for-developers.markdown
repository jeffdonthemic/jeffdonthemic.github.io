The <a href="http://wiki.developerforce.com/index.php/CloudComputingForDotNet" target="_blank">video is targeted for .NET developers</a> but it is applicable to anyone that wants to better understand the advantages of cloud computing from a technical perspective. </span></p>
<p><span class="gI">Very informative and very well done.<br>
