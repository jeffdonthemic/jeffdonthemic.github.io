<p>Like all of the cool kids nowadays, I've switched to <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/2">Sublime Text 2</a> for code wrangling. Sublime rocks for <a href="http://o2js.com/2011/10/29/fell-in-love-with-sublime-text-2/">ton of reasons</a> but I was always depressed when I had to switch back to Eclipse for Force.com work. Luckily about three months ago<a href="http://twitter.com/joeferraro"> Joe Ferraro</a> emailed me about his <a href="https://github.com/joeferraro/MavensMate-SublimeText">Sublime Text 2 plugin for Force.com</a>. I'd used his TextMate version and knew it to be pretty cool.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/joeferraro/MavensMate-SublimeText">The plugin</a> is easy to install and update (Joe's released a ton of cool new stuff) and works extremely well. There are a few bugs/issues but Joe is quick to fix them and I've worked with him on a few items ("worked" as in I tell Joe how I broke it and he fixes it). It has the same type of functionality as you would find in the Force.com plugin for Eclipse. You can create/checkout projects with hooks into git/svn, execute anonymous, run tests (my favorite!) and deploy code to production. There's even an easter egg for Pacman while you wait for your code to deploy.</p>
<p>I've been using the plugin religiously for about two months now for Force.com development and rarely ever fire up Eclipse. Sublime Text 2 is not free but with the addition of Joe's plugin, I think it is a worthwhile investment in productivity.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: Joe did not pay me for this endorsement but I will hit him up for a free beer at <a href="http://www.salesforce.com/dreamforce/DF12/">Dreamforce</a>.</p>
