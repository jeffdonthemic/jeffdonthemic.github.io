<p style="clear: both">Amazon recently unveiled yet another infrastructure building block to their suite of services. <a href="http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2010/04/introducing-the-amazon-simple-notification-service.html" target="_blank">Simple Notification Service</a> (SNS) allows you to build applications with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish/subscribe" target="_blank">publish/subscribe messaging</a> functionality. SNS is distributed and redundant and retries message delivery if necessary. <strong>Owners</strong> create and manage <strong>Topics</strong> (URIs identifying specific topics, content or event types) that are received by <strong>Subscriber</strong> clients (applications, end-users, servers). The delivery of messages are guaranteed by the <strong>Publishers</strong> that send messages to topics. SNS in turn matches all of the topics to the list of subscribers interested in them and delivers the message to each one of them.</p><p style="clear: both"><br style="clear: both" />The SNS API is simple but also proprietary. If you have something running in JMS it shouldn't be a big leap but you are locked into AWS. The service currently support HTTP, HTTPS, EMail and Email-JSON protocols but more are on the road map. They are also working on a point-and-click interface for the <a href="http://console.aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank">AWS Management Console</a>.</p><p style="clear: both">There is no charge for the first 100,000 SNS requests per month, the first 100,000 HTTP/HTTPS pushes and the first 1,000 email deliveries. After that it's $0.06 per 100,000 messages published, $0.06 per 100,000 HTTP message sent and $2.00 per 100,000 Email/Email-JSON notifications.</p><p style="clear: both">Since Force.com was not designed as a messaging platform, perhaps SNS would fit into an external integration landscape? Interesting possibilities.</p><p style="clear: both">The SNS documentation is available <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/sns/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><br class="final-break" style="clear: both" />
