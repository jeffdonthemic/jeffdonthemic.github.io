title:  Force.com Bumper Sticker
description: I got bored yesterday on the flight home from Dreamforce 09  so I whipped up this bumper sticker as a way to encourage people to become Force.com developers. I have an old post titled  Start Developing With Salesforce.Com — Today!  that outlines why I think people should start developing on the Force.com platform. You can order the bumper at zazzle.com  if you are interested.
