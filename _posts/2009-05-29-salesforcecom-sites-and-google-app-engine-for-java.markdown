<p>What a hectic week! We rolled out our Inspection Copy Feedback application with Salesforce.com Sites. The site should appear on the Sites gallery soon but <a href="http://informa.force.com/taylorandfrancis" target="_blank">here is the link</a> to the Site. I'll provide a more detailed review of our Sites experience at a later time.</p>
<p>I also worked on a number of demo apps for the newly announced <a href="/2009/05/27/forcecom-integration-announced-for-gae-java/" target="_blank">Salesforce.com Integration with Google App Engine for Java</a>. I had a couple of applications to release but I just couldn't get them finished with our Sites pilot going live and all of the other projects we are involved in.</p>
<p>I also had a hectic week on the homefront as my youngest son graduated high school, turned 18 and <a href="/2008/12/03/my-son-joined-the-army/" target="_blank">joined the army</a> in the same week.</p>
<p>Now I'm off for two weeks in Spain and Italy with my much better half. Take case Salesforce.com. I hope you are still here when I get back.</p>
