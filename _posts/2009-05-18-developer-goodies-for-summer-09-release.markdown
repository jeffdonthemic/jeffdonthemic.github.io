title:  Developer Goodies for Summer '09 Release
description: I was going through the release notes for Summer 09 and pulling out my favorite developer highlights for a new blog post. Halfway through the post I found an existing wiki page with roughly the exact same information I was writing. Since I am essentially lazy, Im just going to link to this page instead- About the Summer 09 Release . They did however forget Batch Apex  ... not sure how though....??  Theres alot of good stuff coming in Summer 09!

<p>I was going through the release notes for Summer '09 and pulling out my favorite developer highlights for a new blog post. Halfway through the post I found an existing wiki page with roughly the exact same information I was writing. Since I am essentially lazy, I'm just going to link to this page instead: <a href="http://wiki.developerforce.com/index.php/Summer_09" target="_blank">About the Summer '09 Release</a>.</p>
<p>They did however forget <a href="http://blog.sforce.com/sforce/2009/05/batch-apex-a-powerful-new-functionality-in-summer-09.html" target="_blank">Batch Apex</a>... not sure how though....??</p>
<p>There's alot of good stuff coming in Summer '09!</p>
