title:  Apex Algorithm Challenges for Force.com
description: Just prior to Dreamforce 2014, I launched Code Your Way In allowing developers to complete an Apex algorithm challenge for free entrance to our Topcoder Open developer conference . Feel free to try it out. In a nutshell, the node app uses the nforce-tooling plugin for nforce I wrote to submit the code you write for the algorithm to a DE org using the Force.com Tooling API . It compiles your code and runs the accompanying unit tests that Ive already written and returns the results.
