It's funny how the right kid "finds" you. We got Kira straight out of the NICU with a ton of special needs as she was 3 1/2 months premature. With all of her physical problems she's still our favorite (we joke with our bio kids that we love her more than them). Her <a href="/2008/09/12/adoption-is-final/" target="_blank">adoption was final</a> on September 12, 2008 and we plan to celebrate it each year.</p>
