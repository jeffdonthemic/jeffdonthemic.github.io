<p>Dashcode comes with a number of quickstart templates (rss reader, counter, system monitor, etc.) so it's easy to get up and running. One of the cool things we have at the non-profit I work for is a calendar that displays a series of operational indicators. Since we have an number of C level users on Macs, I thought this might be an interesting Widget.</p>

We don't specifically have any RSS feeds at the organization but I quickly massaged some existing code and downloaded <a href="http://cfrss.riaforge.org/" target="_blank">Ray Camden's RSS.cfc </a> and whipped one up in no time. I simply pointed the Widget to my new RSS URL, added in a few customized graphic and viola!</p>

<p>The entire project took me about 30 minutes to complete. This would have been much quicker if I hadn't started at 5:15am.</p>
