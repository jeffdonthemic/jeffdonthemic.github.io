<p>The major reasons are fairly obious to anyone that has built an application using Salesforce.com. Applications are faster and cheaper to build on the tried and trusted Force.com platform.</p>
<p>From a programming perspective, the article made a statement that caught me totally off-guard: &quot;The Salesforce.com programming language, Apex, is widely considered more business-like than Java or .net.&quot; I've been using Salesforce.com for quite awhile, been involved with Apex since its inception, read quite a bit about Salesforce.com, am a Java and .NET developer and have <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>NEVER</strong></span> heard anyone utter a statement like &quot;...Apex, is widely considered more business-like than Java or .net.&quot;</p>
