<p><a href="http://www.firemoss.com/post.cfm/spring-hibernate-groovy-cfml-flex-swiz-hoagie">Joe Rinehart is proposing</a> a new development stack for rapid, RIA development that includes some of my favorite and most used technologies:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Business layer written in Groovy (Java)</li>
	<li>JPA and Hibernate for database persistence</li>
	<li>Spring for the service layer</li>
	<li>Coldspring / Model-Glue / ColdFusion for the presentation layer</li>
	<li>JMS and Swiz for a nice RIA client push</li>
</ul>
So other ideas floating around include:
<ul>
	<li>An ANT based installer to get everything configured and setup properly</li>
	<li>Addition of  Tomcat,  JBoss,  Railo and  OpenBD as optional application servers</li>
	<li>An "Enterprise RIA" stack with BlazeDS and <a href="http://www.springsource.org/spring-flex" target="_blank">Spring's new BlazeDS integration</a> (my personal favorite)</li>
	<li>An automated Flex project template with the Swiz framework (I'm hoping for Mate as well)</li>
	<li>An automated Eclipse project to hook in an existing application context</li>
</ul>
I volunteered to be a beta tester so cross your fingers that I get accepted. I'm so excited!!
