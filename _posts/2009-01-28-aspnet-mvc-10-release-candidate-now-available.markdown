title:  ASP.NET MVC 1.0 Release Candidate Now Available
description: The ASP.NET MVC RC is now available  and I am so excited that I can hardly stand it! At work we do alot of .NET development but I cannot stand the ViewState and Postback paradigm. Im been tinkering around with with ASP.NET MVC for quite awhile and have a couple of prototypes under my belt. According to the post, the 1.0 version should be released sometime in Febraury. Ive been seeing alot of posts on non-.NET sites with positive feedback. I think ASP.NET MVC may make it easier for Java developer
