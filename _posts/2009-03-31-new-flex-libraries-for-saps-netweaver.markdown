SAP's NetWeaver Product Manager Thomas Jung introduces a new section for eLearning, blogs, and other learning materials from both Adobe and SAP regarding development of interfaces with Flex/Flash and SAP.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sdn.sap.com/irj/sdn/adobe-flash-islands" target="_blank">This post discusses</a> the Web Dynpro for ABAP framework in SAP NetWeaver 7.0 EhP1 and how it provides new libraries that make it easy to add rich data visualization to applications using the Flex framework.</p>
<p>The Adobe Flash capabilities in Web Dynpro allow a custom-developed Flex or Flash control to be integrated into SAP's Web Dynpro applications with minimal effort. SAP provides a set of libraries that handle the mapping of data sources, properties, events and event parameters, as well as a way to bind the SWF files into Web Dynpro as a standard UI element.</p>
<p>I may have to talk to the SAP team and see if I can get a login....</p>
